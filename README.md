# FootballResults

# Introduction
This is a python3 script which gets the lates football results around the world !

You can run the program and you will get your results at "doc" dir. In the current year and current month after that. In month dir you have a day dir
for each day that you run the program it will store the results in ".txt" file (raw data) and a ".html" file which is modifyed to be userfriendly.

# Tools
You need to have python3 installed first. After that you need prettytable and mechanicalsoup libraries. In case of having time, i will upload a toolkit that
installs the requirements of the program.

# How it works ?
So basically we open a connection to a website that has the football results, and then by mechanicalsoup with scrape the website and its pages
to get all the results we need. After that we use the prettytable to create the football tables with the data we have.

And for the last part we add the custom created ".css" file to the html file , so it gets layout.
